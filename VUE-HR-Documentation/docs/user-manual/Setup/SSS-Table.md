## Add an SSS Contribution Table

<details>
  <summary class="bold">Definition of Terms for SSS Contribution Table</summary>
  <div class="definition">The Social Security System (SSS) Contribution Table is a guide used to determine the amount of contribution that an employee and their employer must pay to the SSS. It lists down the salary range and the corresponding contribution rates for both the employee and employer. The table also shows the total monthly contribution amount that should be remitted to the SSS. The contribution is deducted from the employee's salary and an equivalent amount is paid by the employer to the SSS.
